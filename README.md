## An intuitive CLI to get audio/video duration in current folder and subfolders

### How to use?

<br>

1- Make sure you have ffmpeg installed, see the guides below on how to install:

- Linux: https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/
- Windows: https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/
- macOS: https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg/wiki/Installing-ffmpeg-on-Mac-OS-X

2- install the CLI using npm (recommended):

```sh
npm i -g duration-cli
```

or, run using npx (runs the app without installing on your system):

```sh
npx duration-cli
```

<br>

3- Go to any directory you'd like to calculate the duration for,, and run the following command:

```sh
dur
```

#### and voila ðŸš€
